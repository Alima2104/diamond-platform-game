# diamond-platform-game
Description:
This game is for 2 players. The goal is to go through “trials”, collect crystals, and get to the airplane to fly away as soon as possible. There is a small problem – you only have 60 seconds.
I wanted to try to create a game myself, similar to the one I played as a child. I always liked the opportunity to play with a friend at the same time, so I decided to add this opportunity to my game.
For this game, I created several classes: 2 character classes, a platform class, a platform class that cannot be stepped on aka platform enemies, a timer class, an airplane class, and a crystal class. Use the A, W, D keys to move Player 2 and the arrow keys to move Player 1.
